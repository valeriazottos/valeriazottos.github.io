In 2021, I graduated with a BA in International Relations from [Univerisad de San Andrés](www.udesa.edu.ar), where I also began a Master’s in Economics. My interest in economic development, public policy, growth, and poverty led me to deepen my training in economics. I value interdisciplinary perspectives as they foster critical thinking, integrative analysis, and more effective team collaboration.
